Assignment 1 Question 5 involves further extending the shell (created in A1Q4) to accomodate the preloading of variables. 
By including a file within the working directory called ".shell_init" containing valid 'set' statements, the program
will read in these variables for use within the shell (e.g. ls $xxxx).
