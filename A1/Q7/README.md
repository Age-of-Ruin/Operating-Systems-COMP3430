# Multi-threaded Minimum Finder
Assignment 1 Question 7 involves reading a file (called 'numbers.txt') containing 1 integer per line, and finds the minimum value of
the integers using multiple pthreads. The program must be provided 2 arguments: 

1)numThreads - which will specify how many threads to use
2)numElts - this will specify the total number of elements to read from the file (and used in finding the minimum) 

The syntax of calling the program is as follows: 'a.out numThreads numElts'.
